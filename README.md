# Splice-Core
Splice is a compiled programming language that started as a small experiment in lower level programming, but has evolved into a multi-month passion project. Written entirely in Go, Splice supports memory allocation and deallocation, multiple data types, caching and strict typing. You can open the splice console by cloning the code above and running main.go (provided you have Go installed on your computer).
